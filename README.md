# cryptography
A collection of cryptography algorithms and codes implemented in different programming languages.  
This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and demonstrating how classic and modern ciphers work.

## Available Algorithms
- [Caesar Cipher](./caesar-cipher/)
- [Vigerene Cipher](./vigerene-cipher/)
- [One Time Pad](./one-time-pad/)
- [Rail Fence Cipher](./rail-fence/)
- [Route Cipher](./route-cipher/)
- More coming soon...

## Contribution

### To add a new algorithm:
- Create a directory in lower-case using dashes (e.g. `caesar-cipher`)
- Inside it, create at least one language directory with code (e.g. `python/main.py`)
- Document functions with comments as needed

### To add a new script to an existing algorithm
- Add a new language directory if it doesnâ€™t exist
- Document functions with comments as needed
